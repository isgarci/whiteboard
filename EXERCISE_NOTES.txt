In this exercise, I had tried to adapt an example of auth configuration using Google Firebase Authenticator into an owned instance of Google Firebase.

The platform Firebase was chosen primarily because of immediate availability at the moment of developing the exercise.

Since Firebase is primarily for development purpose, Azure, GCP or any other production cloud platform would have been chosen if the project were to be deployed in production. 

I had created a Project and a Web app at Google Firebase and configured credentials.json after the parameters provided by the server. 

The example chosen, even though not perfectly implemented, differentiates frontend and backend and uses containerization. For implementation production, probably a different language from javascript would have been preferred.

The example has a raw implementation of a list of items.
In order to achieve the whiteboard functionality, it should be vastly extended.
The example is not even close to achieve that purpose. Again, time restrictions.

All the basic domain logic of the collaborative whiteboard is still remaining to be implemented and in this case, I would have probably continued with FCM ( Firebase Cloud Messaging ) in order to implement the messaging functionality:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/fcm-architecture

An alternative consideration would be to use for example, Mesibo platform to take care of the authentication, but an external integration with infrastructure out of the Firebase would have been necessary.   

The exercise is still presenting problems with routing at react. It creates the backend and frontend, but is not running as expected.
